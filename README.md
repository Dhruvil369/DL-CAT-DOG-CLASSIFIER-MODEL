-> Cat-Dog Classification Model

-> Overview

-> This project implements a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. 
   The model leverages the power of CNNs for feature extraction and image recognition, providing a robust and accurate
   solution for binary image classification tasks.
